The expectation of $X$ is the weighted (in proportion to the probabilities) average of the possible values of $X$.

Suppose that you spin a wheel $k$ times a let $m_{i}$ be the amount of money you win at the $i$-th position. Then the average money that you gain will be.  Let $k_{i}$ be the amount of spins that land on the $i$-th position.

$$
\begin{align*}\\
\\\ M &= \frac{m_{1}k_{1}+ m_{2}k_{2}+...}{k}
\end{align*}
$$
Since $\frac{k_{i}}{k} \approx p_{i}$ then we can say $M = m_{1}p_{1}+m_{2}p_{2}+...$ Then we can say for the expected value to be 

$$
\begin{align*}\\
\\E[X] &= \sum\limits_{x}xP_{X}(x)
\end{align*}
$$
