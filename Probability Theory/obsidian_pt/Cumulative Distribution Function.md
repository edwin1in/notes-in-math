Since we have been dealing with PMFs and PDFs, the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) describes both of them in one.  The CDF of a random variable $X$ is denoted as $F_{X}(x)$ and provides the probability $P(X \leq x)$.

$$
F_{X}(x) = P(X \leq x) = \begin{cases} \sum\limits_{k \leq x} p_{X}(k), \ \text{if $X$ is discrete}, \\ \int^{x}_{-\} \end{cases}
$$
