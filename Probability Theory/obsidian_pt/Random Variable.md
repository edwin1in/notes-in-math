Suppose that the outcome of an experiment is not a numerical value and that we would like to assign a numerical value to that outcome. Then, the random variable function assigns an outcome to a real-number value. Denoted as $X(\omega)$.

$$
\begin{align*}\\\\
X:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}
\end{align*}
$$
### [[Discrete Random Variable]]
A discrete random variable takes on a finite or countably infinite number of values.

### Functions of Random Variables
We can create another random variable by applying transformation on $X$. For example let $Y = aX + b$, for some integers $a,b$. We can also say $Y = g(X) = aX + b$. Since $Y$ is a function of a random variable $X$, then $Y$ is also a random variable. Then the PMF is whenever $g(x) = y$.

$$
\begin{align*}\\
\\   p_{Y}(y) &= \sum\limits_{\set{x:g(x)=y}} p_{X}(x)
\end{align*}
$$
