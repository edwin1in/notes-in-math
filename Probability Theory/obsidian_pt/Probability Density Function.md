Suppose that we have a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then a random variable $X$ is continuous iff there's a non-negative function $f_{X}$ , called the probability density function or PDF, such that 

$$
P(X \in S) = \int_{S}f_{X}(x)dx
$$
If we have an interval as our subset then

$$
P(a \leq X \leq )
$$
