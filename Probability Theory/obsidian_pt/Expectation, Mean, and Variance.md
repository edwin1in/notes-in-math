The expectation of $X$ is the weighted (in proportion to the probabilities) average of the possible values of $X$.

Suppose that you spin a wheel $k$ times a let $m_{i}$ be the amount of money you win at the $i$-th position. Then the average money that you gain will be.  Let $k_{i}$ be the amount of spins that land on the $i-th$ position

$$
\begin{align*}\\
\\\ M &= \frac{m_{1}k_1}{k}
\end{align*}
