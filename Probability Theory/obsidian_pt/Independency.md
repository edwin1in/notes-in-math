### [[Conditional Probability]]
When the given information/event $B$ does not alter the probability of $A$ then,
$$
	\begin{align*}\\
\\ P(A|B) &= P(A)
\end{align*}
$$
From here we can deduce that 
$$
\begin{align*}\\
\\ P(A \cap B) &= P(A)P(B)
\end{align*}
$$
By symmetry, if event $A$ is independent of $B$ then event $B$ is independent of $A$.
