The formulation of a probabilistic model consists of only one experiment. That is, if we have an experiment of flipping a coin three times, we wouldn't have three experiments, just one. From the experiment, we have a **sample space** which is the set containing all of the possible outcomes of the experiment. Subsets of the sample space are called **events**. Under a probability law, we can assign a non-negative number to an event.

The sample space for the experiment of flipping a coin three times will be the set $A = \set{HHH, HHT, ..., TTT}$.

>**Sample Space:** Denoted as $\Omega$, is the set of all possible **outcomes** of an experiment.
**Events**: A subset of the sample space, a collection of possible outcomes.
**Probability Law: ** Under some probability law $P:\mathcal{P}(\Omega) \to [0,1]$, assigns an event $A$ to a non-negative number $P(A)$. It is considered the "likelihood" of $A$.
