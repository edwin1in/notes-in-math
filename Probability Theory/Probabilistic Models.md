The formulation of a probabilistic model consists of only one experiment. That is, if we have an experiment of flipping a coin three times, we wouldn't have three experiments, just one.

## Elements of a Probabilistic Model

**Sample Space:** Denoted as $\Omega$, is the set of all possible **outcomes** of an experiment.
**Events**: A subset of the sample space, a collection of possible outcomes.
**Probability Law: ** Under some probability law $P:\mathcal{P}(\Omega) \to [0,1]$, maps an event to a
